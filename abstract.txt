### üîê Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning for CIoT

This project introduces a two-level privacy framework for Consumer IoT (CIoT) using **Federated Learning + Partially Homomorphic Encryption (PHE)**. Unlike fully homomorphic encryption (slow) or differential privacy (less accurate), PHE enables efficient, secure aggregation of encrypted models‚Äîno raw data shared. Our results show improved resistance to inference attacks with lower false alarms and better model performance.
